## Conclusion

Signatory countries of the Berna Convention must adopt  the *implied licence* expressed by Berne1971.

As a general matter, this *implied licence* subsists in “original” works of *licensor* (author or holder of the copyright) as soon as the work (licensed material) is fixed in some tangible medium of expression. In this context, the *licensee* is a copy holder.

Inferred "standard clauses" that build this *implied license* as licensee obligations:

Label  | Subject | The licensee must to 
---    | ---     | ---
*Ask*  | Permission | check or ask any permission for licensor.
*BY*   | Attribution | cite the licensor, ex. in a copy-of-fragment for quotation use.
*NC*   | No Comercial use | can't do any commercial use of the work.
*ND*   | No Derivatives   | can't do derivative works from the work.
*SA*   | Share-alike      | when permited, the copies must preserve the same licence, but in a explicit way.

Inferred "standard clauses" that build this *implied license* as licensor exclusive rights:

Label  | Licensor exclusive right 
---    | ---
*Copy* | To distribute, producing copies or reproductions of the work, and to sell those copies (including electronic copies).
*Derivatives*   | To create derivative works (works that adapt the original work)
*Display* |To perform or display the work publicly.
*Dispose* |To sell or cede these rights to others.
*stream*  |To transmit or display by radio, video or digital streaming.

Inferred "standard clauses" that build this *implied license* as licensee rights:

Label  | Subject | Licensee right
---    | ---     | ---
*Fair* | Fair use | A fragment or local copy in special conditions, as little quotations, and some personal or educational uses.
*Sync* | Simultaneous publishing | Reclaim the  protection and status of simultaneously published when "within 30 days".
*Wait* | Wait for CC0 | Reclaim the monopoly time-out, 50 years after works's first publishing or author's death.
